# 🏥 MedHistory

## 📘 Project Title
**MedHistory – A Blockchain-Based Medical Record System**

---

## 🧩 Project Description
MedHistory is a decentralized application (DApp) built on Ethereum using Solidity.  
It allows patients to **securely store**, **access**, and **share** their medical history without relying on centralized servers.  
All medical records are stored immutably on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and privacy.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision
To create a **trustless**, **secure**, and **accessible** medical record system that empowers patients to control their health data and share it with healthcare providers safely.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- **Patient-Owned Data:** Each user owns and manages their medical records.
- **Tamper-Proof Storage:** All records are stored immutably on the blockchain.
- **Privacy First:** Only the patient can view or manage their data.
- **Audit Trail:** Every update is recorded with timestamps for verification.
- **Future Expandability:** Can be extended to allow doctor verification and consent-based sharing.

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **Solidity (v0.8.x)** for smart contract logic  
- **Ethereum Blockchain**  
- **Remix IDE / Truffle / Hardhat** for deployment and testing
